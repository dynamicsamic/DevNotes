OOP - is a programming technique (approach) every essential building block of a program is an object derived from a class and the program as a whole is a set of objects. 

#### Main principles
- Polymorphism - is the ability to treat objects of different types (classes) in a single way. This principle refers to interfaces. Classes that implement a particular interface produce objects that can be used interchangeably.
- Encapsulation - is the ability to hide implementation details. This principle refers to creating API's. A class hides away its implementation details and provides an API to interact with.
